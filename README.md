The Tip Calculator app, developed in Kotlin using Android Studio, streamlines the process of calculating tips for services. Users can easily input the service cost and select their preferred tip percentage through radio buttons, with options for Perfect Service (20%), Good Service (15%), and Normal Service (10%). A convenient round-up switch is available for those who wish to round up the tip amount. Upon pressing the "Calculate" button, the app dynamically computes the tip, providing instant and accurate results. The straightforward design ensures an intuitive user experience, making it a valuable tool for quick and efficient tip calculations. Future enhancements could include localization, customizable tipping percentages, and a history feature for tracking previous calculations. Overall, the app offers a user-friendly solution for anyone seeking an efficient way to determine gratuity.
